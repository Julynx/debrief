# TODO

- [ ] Parse and display description from pyproject.toml
- [ ] Parse dependencies from pyproject.toml, falling back to requirements.txt if not present.
- [ ] Ellipsis and "read more" links for sections that are cut off by max lines budgets or other constraints.
- [ ] Max defintions in definition tree, plus ensure every single section has a max lines budget with a sensible default.
- [ ] Line width ellipsis for lines of any section that are too long (more than 300 chars).
